🙋🏾‍♀️ _**About Me**_

Hi, I'm Supraja, an Instrumentation & Control Engineer 🎓 who took a detour into language specialization 🇩🇪 and is now making her way back into the world of automation 🚀

🔧 I'm currently focused on building hands-on projects in PLC programming and HMI design using **TwinCAT**, **RSLogix** and **CODESYS**, exploring control systems through code, logic, and a bit of visual flair 📊.

🎓 Alongside, I'm completing Beckhoff’s official online certifications while applying the concepts in self-driven simulation projects 💡.

🎯 Always learning, always building. More projects on the way!

🌐 Languages: English, Tamil, German, a bit of Hindi

💡 Exploring the intersection of automation, design, and problem-solving

☕ Outside work, you'll find me immersed in a book 📖, cycling on weekends 🚲, going for long walks on weekdays 🚶🏾‍♀️‍➡️

### ⚡ _**What I’m Up To**_
- 💡 Creating automation simulations involving sensors, actuators & control logic
- 🧠 Currently working **Ladder Logic, Structured Text, Functional Block Diagrams** and real-time trend visualizations
- 👩🏾‍💻 Slowly working toward a career in automation, one project at a time
- 🌱 Learning about Twincat Safety Systems
- 📁 Organizing my projects into this portfolio (you’re looking at it!)

🤝 _**Let’s Connect!**_

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on small automation projects, control logic experiments, or HMI design ideas  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with exploring advanced PLC functions, safety logic, and real-world system integration  
- 💬 Ask me about career transition stories, control systems or just chat about books, anime, or the best Indian food 🍿📚🍥

🙌 _**Stay curious, keep building**_

Whether you’re here to browse, brainstorm, or collaborate - welcome to my little corner of automation and ideas.
